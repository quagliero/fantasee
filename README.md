#### See more from your fantasy league.

The nfl.com fantasy site and apps are getting better, but they lack more in-depth cumulative historical data for your league. Which is a shame because the information is all there. I'm talking overall records, head-to-heads, playoff appearances, total trades, most common trading partners, etc etc, and any and all other information that can be gleaned from scraping your league history into a db and querying the data.

No idea how this is going to be structured.

No idea what tools to use.

Better to just suck it and see, right?

### @todo

- [x] create repo
- [ ] ???*
- [ ] profit


#####* Probably should start with something like
- [x] Scrape basic [almanac](http://chumbo.league.fantasy.nfl.com/league/874089/history) page
- [x] Scrape managers
- [x] Scrape trades
- [x] Scrape schedule and results
- [x] Scrape draft results
- [x] Scrape standings
- [ ] Create RESTful routes to post/put scraped data
- [ ] Insert scraped data to a database
- [ ] Display that data on a page
